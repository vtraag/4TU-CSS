The interesting thing of eigenvector centrality is that it is similar to the proportion of time spent in a node if a *random walker* would traverse the network, choosing links to follow at random. In directed graphs there may be so-called *sinks*: nodes with no outgoing edges. If you think of a random walker, you can imagine the problem: (s)he gets stuck in a sink. The opposite of *sinks* are called *sources*: nodes with no incoming edge. A random walker would then never arrive in a source.\n",

    "There are various motiviations for studying random graphs. The first is that it provides a baseline to compare real-world networks with. In other words, it can function as a null-model. If a certain characteristic is  reproduced in a random graph (e.g. path length), then such a simple random process already provides an \"explanation\" for the observation. That is, we don't need to make any other assumption than randomness about any underlying process to explain that characteristic. On the other hand, if a certain characteristic is not reproduced in a random graph (e.g. clustering), then this characteristic is unlikely to be seen at random. This is usually what is understood as \"significance\" because if has a low p-value (i.e. a low probability of observing that characteristic under the null-hypothesis). However, it also make clear that the random graph in that case is a bad model for our observations. This seems to be sometimes forgotten when people use \"significance\": it simply means your null-model is really bad at reproducing your observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason for having null-models is that they may provide some (first-order) approximation of real-world graphs. The amount of data always remains limited (even today) and are always only one possible observation.
